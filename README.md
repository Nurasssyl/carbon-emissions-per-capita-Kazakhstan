I made a map of the distribution of carbon dioxide per capita in Kazakhstan in 2023.

I developed this visualization using the R programming language using the libraries: tidyverse, geodata, terra, exactextractr, sf, classintimdevky.

The more CO2 there is in the atmosphere, the darker the area is painted over.

Looking at this map, we can draw several conclusions:
1. The Aksu district of Pavlodar region is considered to be the most polluted area.
2. The neighboring Ekibastuz district is in second place.
3. They are followed by Birzhan Sal district of Akmola region.
4. Moyinkum district of Zhambyl region also differs from its neighbors in its darker color.

According to UNDP Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan is one of the 10 countries in the world in terms of carbon dioxide emissions intensity. The main share of hashtag emissions#CO2 is accounted for by the industrial sector. Moreover, 35% of the country's electricity consumption is accounted for by electric motors, namely transformers.
